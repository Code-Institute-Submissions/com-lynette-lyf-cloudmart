## Credits
### Media  
I do not own any of the content shown in this website. Gifs, background images and the product images and their description were taken from various websites. This e-commerce platform is entirely fictional and resemblances in its name to actual companies, are entirely coincidental and thereafter do not aim to replicate them in any way.
